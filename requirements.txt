# claude-code-project-index - External Dependencies
#
# Version: 2.0
# Date: 2025-11-03
#
# IMPORTANT: This is the first time external dependencies are introduced.
# Epic 1 functionality (split index, lazy loading) uses Python 3.12+ stdlib only.
# Epic 2 introduces optional MCP server functionality that requires these dependencies.
#
# Installation:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# For development:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # (when created)

# ==============================================================================
# Epic 2: Story 2.10 - MCP Server Implementation
# ==============================================================================

# MCP Python SDK - Enables exposing project index as MCP tools for AI agents
# Used by: project_index_mcp.py
# Docs: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk
mcp>=1.0.0

# Pydantic v2 - Input validation for MCP tools (transitive dependency via mcp)
# Used by: project_index_mcp.py for Pydantic models
# Docs: https://docs.pydantic.dev/
pydantic>=2.0.0

# ==============================================================================
# Epic 3: Story 3.2 - Performance Benchmarking
# ==============================================================================

# psutil - Process and system utilities for memory monitoring during benchmarks
# Used by: scripts/benchmark.py for measuring peak RSS memory usage
# Docs: https://psutil.readthedocs.io/
# Optional: Benchmark suite will skip memory monitoring if not installed
psutil>=5.9.0

# ==============================================================================
# Optional Dependencies (for future enhancements)
# ==============================================================================

# httpx - Async HTTP client (not currently required, but recommended for future)
# Used by: MCP server if HTTP transport is added
# httpx>=0.27.0

# Note: Core indexing functionality (scripts/project_index.py, scripts/loader.py)
# remains stdlib-only and does NOT require these dependencies.
# Only the MCP server (project_index_mcp.py) requires external dependencies.
